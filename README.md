# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using a modular pipeline, demonstrating data preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization.

## Overview

**Objective**: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave a service) using classification models.

**Dataset**: Telco Customer Churn dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

**Features**:
- Modular code with separate modules for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision tree and AddaBoost with GridSearchCV in a single function.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a confusion matrix.
- Resolved label encoding issues for consistent pipeline performance.

**Tech Stack**:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Joblib.
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA, Git for version control.
